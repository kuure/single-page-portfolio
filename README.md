# Single Page Portfolio

A simple one-page, JavaScript-free portfolio style website example.

### Notes:

By custom, the default file displayed by a web browser for any directory
is named `index.html`, so we stick with that convention.

This file is named `README.md`, and uses a format called Markdown to
render text that can easily be converted to HTML. It is standard for
folders of software ("repositories" or "repos") in GitHub to have these
files to explain various things about the project. 

In this case, this file will be different for each **branch** in this repo
with updated information on the steps performed.


## Step 04:

### Adding HTML `<sections>`

First I've added three different HTML `<section>` elements, which most
accurately describe semantically what these parts of the document
represent.

Each section has a unique `id` attribute; there can only be one of any
`id` in a document which allows us to differentiate the three sections,
and the use of the `id` allows us to focus each of these elements
specifically in the window. 


### `<section>` CSS

Each of these sections has been given a different background color; the
background color of the `<body>` has been set to red in order to make it
more visible behind the other elements.

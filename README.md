# Single Page Portfolio

A simple one-page, JavaScript-free portfolio style website example.

### Notes:

By custom, the default file displayed by a web browser for any directory
is named `index.html`, so we stick with that convention.

This file is named `README.md`, and uses a format called Markdown to
render text that can easily be converted to HTML. It is standard for
folders of software ("repositories" or "repos") in GitHub to have these
files to explain various things about the project. 

In this case, this file will be different for each **branch** in this repo
with updated information on the steps performed.

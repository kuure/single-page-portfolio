# Single Page Portfolio

A simple one-page, JavaScript-free portfolio style website example.

### Notes:

By custom, the default file displayed by a web browser for any directory is
named `index.html`, so we stick with that convention.

This file is named `README.md`, and uses a format called Markdown to render text
that can easily be converted to HTML. It is standard for folders of software
("repositories" or "repos") in GitHub to have these files to explain various
things about the project. 

In this case, this file will be different for each **branch** in this repo with
updated information on the steps performed.



## Step 03: 

### Default CSS

This step adds content to the `stylesheet.css` document; these values reset the
document's padding and margin, as well as telling all elements with size
specifications to calculate those based on any padding and border values instead
of using the default browser setting.

The settings are commented in the CSS file itself.

There is no text visible in the browser window, but if you open your file in a
browser now you should see a pale yellow background.

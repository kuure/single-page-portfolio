# Single Page Portfolio

A simple one-page, JavaScript-free portfolio style website example.

### Notes:

By custom, the default file displayed by a web browser for any
directory is named `index.html`, so we stick with that convention.

This file is named `README.md`, and uses a format called Markdown to
render text that can easily be converted to HTML. It is standard for
folders of software ("repositories" or "repos") in GitHub to have
these files to explain various things about the project. 

In this case, this file will be different for each **branch** in this
repo with updated information on the steps performed.


## Step 01:

Start by creating the files you need:

- a file named `index.html` to structure your content 
- a folder named `css`in order to store your types of documents separately
- a file named `stylesheet.css` inside of the folder above

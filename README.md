# Single Page Portfolio

A simple one-page, JavaScript-free portfolio style website example.

### Notes:

By custom, the default file displayed by a web browser for any directory
is named `index.html`, so we stick with that convention.

This file is named `README.md`, and uses a format called Markdown to
render text that can easily be converted to HTML. It is standard for
folders of software ("repositories" or "repos") in GitHub to have these
files to explain various things about the project. 

In this case, this file will be different for each **branch** in this repo
with updated information on the steps performed.


## Step 01:


### Text Editors

To write HTML and CSS, you will need to use a text editor; I recommend you
use Visual Studio Code. For web development, the extension named **Live
Server** by Ritwick Dey is invaluable.


### Files and Folders

This step will depend on your computer (Mac vs Windows vs Other...) and
its settings. An important one is to set your computer to always show any
file extension, so you know if you're looking at a `.png` or `.jpg` image,
for example.

You will need to start by creating a folder to hold all of your files; in
this example I'm using one named `single-page-portfolio`.

Inside of that, create the two files and one additional folder you'll
need:

- a file named `index.html` to structure your content 
- a folder named `css`in order to store your types of documents separately
- a file named `stylesheet.css` inside of the `css` folder 

These steps can be done via your Windows Explorer or Mac Finder, or from
within Visual Studio Code itself.


### Opening Folders in Visual Studio Code

VS Code likes to work from within a defined folder; it's always best to
select "Open Folder" from the `File` menu when you work on projects.

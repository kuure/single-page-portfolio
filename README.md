## Step 07:

### Fixing the Navigation

There are a few ways to deal with the navigation. The easiest way is to
set it always be stuck to the top of the page, with the page-specific
content visible below it. 

Before doing this, it is a good time to think about anything else you
might want at the top of the page - things like your name, a search box, a
logo, or other such things.


### The `<header>` Elemenent

Unlike the `<head>`, which contains metadata never visible in the browser
window, the `<header>` tag is the semantic element for elements that might
collectively appear at the top, or head, of every screen.

I'll use this to put a container around the site name as well as the
navigation bar, then use Flexbox to distribute them horizontally by
default with the option to distribute them in all sorts of ways.
